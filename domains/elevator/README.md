# Elevator Domain

In a building of `x` floors there are `y` people that needs to move trough the floors using `z` elevators.

The elevators can move up and down, and load and unload passengers

In PDDL1.0 the elevator can only have capacity of infinity (`domain-capacity-infinity.pddl`) or capacity of 1 (`domain-capacity-1.pddl`)

Some simple problems are available under the name `problem-x-y-z.pddl`
